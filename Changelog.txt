Tristian:
	Incorporated new character's into current Character standards
	Changed Frank and Greg's skills so that don't spawn errors if Trevor isn't there
	Changed Trevor's skill to work with assigning targets after blocking, now it checks if anyone is trying to block for any of his targets, assigns the new targets and calls CombatManager.DoAction(this, "throw") three times
	Renamed Chikako and Haruna to Elizabeth and Victoria(I should have done this on my version a long time ago) and added base.Start() to their start functions
	Separated transformation and life-gain in Mei's Skill3(Cup of Tea) according to the skill doc
	Added code to Skill2(Clean-Up) so that she moves herself to the end of the queue and collects half of all balls used this turn(this may be buggy because of how it alters the queue; needs testing)
